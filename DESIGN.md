# LosslessCut Design Guidelines & Resources

A collection of design contribution guidelines and resources for LosslessCut.

> **All participating designers are highly encouraged to shape and evolve these guidelines!**

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

LosslessCut is the swiss army knife of lossless video/audio editing. 

LosslessCut aims to be the ultimate cross platform graphical user interface for extremely fast and lossless operations on video, audio, subtitle and other related media files. 

We highly encourage you to [download](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases) and try the tool on your own first.

## ðŸš¢ How to contribute design

1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues) here on GitHub (we label them with `design: ðŸ’…required`)
2. Feel free to open an issue on your own if you find something you would like to contribute to the project and use the `design: ðŸ’¡idea` label for it.
3. Clone the public Figma files if available or create new ones and share them publicly
4. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions

**We encourage you to:**

- Get in touch with the team by starting a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions).
