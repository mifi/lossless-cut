    "highlightsMd": "- ‼️ Upgraded Electron to 38 - They dropped support for macOS 11\n- 🆕 Markers: Segments that don't have any end time are now considered \"markers\". They are rendered differently, and are excluded from exports. Markers can be useful for bookmarking locations on the timeline and all markers can be batch exported as screenshots.\n- 🔈 Play multiple audio tracks simultaneously (with FFmpeg-assisted playback)\n- ✅ Remember segment selected/deselected state inside `.llc` file\n- 💿 Split timeline by byte size\n- Modify segments by JavaScript expression\n- Upgraded FFmpeg to 8.0\n- Drastically improve performance of FFmpeg-assisted playback for non-natively supported codecs/formats\n- Improve UI performance and increase max segments to 1000\n- Toggle tracks by expression\n- CSV export/import tags as extra columns\n- New keyboard actions:\n  - `toggleDarkMode`: Toggle dark mode\n  - `toggleStripCurrentFilter`: Toggle tracks using current filter\n  - `toggleStripAll`: Keep or discard all tracks\n  - `toggleStripSubtitle`: Keep or discard subtitle tracks\n  - `toggleStripVideo`: Keep or discard video tracks\n  - `selectSegmentsAtCursor`\n  - `makeCursorTimeZero`: Allow setting timeline zero offset to current cursor time - this effectively also means allowing a negative time offset\n- New shortcuts:\n  - <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>up</kbd> Jump & seek to previous segment\n  - <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>down</kbd> Jump & seek to next segment\n  - <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>pageup</kbd> Jump & seek to first segment\n  - <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>pagedown</kbd> Jump & seek to last segment\n- Add new file name template variables:\n  - `CUT_DURATION`\n  - `CUT_FROM_NUM`\n  - `CUT_TO_NUM`\n  - `FILE_EXPORT_COUNT`\n  - `EXPORT_COUNT`\n  - `SEG_LABEL` (cut+merge mode)\n- Change `SEG_NUM` and `SEG_NUM_INT` variables: they will now correspond to the original index of the segment as shown in the number on the segment list. New variables `SELECTED_SEG_NUM` and `SELECTED_SEG_NUM_INT` can be used for previous behavior (where the numbering is based on the segment's number in the list of *selected* segments).\n- All segments will now have a start time defined - `.llc` project file version bumped to v2 (to migrate missing `start` times). Missing end time now means that the segment is a marker (previously it meant the segment extended to end of timeline).\n"
