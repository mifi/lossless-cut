- Remove "Fix video codec tag / ID" option: **Codec tag will no longer be auto corrected**, as it turned out to cause problems with some files. Instead you can override codec tag for individual tracks in the "tracks" dialog
- Add a `hevc_metadata=aud=insert` bitstream filter in the track editor
- New action `generateOverviewWaveform` to generate a full waveform overview
- Minor improvements and fixes
